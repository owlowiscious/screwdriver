Screw Driver
============

Description
-----------

An incomplete game. Will probably elaborate on things later.

Turn-based fighting, dialog, etc.

It still needs a proper ending, and character stats, levels, etc.

TODOS
------

-   Add images of twilight/applejack
-   artwork that doesn't suck.
-   Better animations
-   a character stat/ inventory system. Currently ad-hoc and can't pick up things
-   Combat system with actual dialog and AI. 
    Currently, the only opponent is a piano.
    +   As part of that, a boss fight.
-   [a story]
